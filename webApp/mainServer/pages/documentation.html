        <section id="Purpose">
          <h3>1.1. Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            GaMon will be an application that will offer an easy and simple way
            of managing the information related to the trash that is collected
            periodically in a given region. In this way, people will become more
            mature in the way in which they store trash and the environment in
            which they live will be cleaner.
          </p>

        <section id="Intended-audience">
          <h3>1.2 Intended audience</h3>
          <p>
            This application will be designed to be used by the citizens of a
            certain region, by the persons that are responsible with the garbage
            collection and for the authorities that manage how the process of
            trash collection works at the large scale.

          <h3>2.1 Product functions</h3>
          <p>GaMon will have the following functionalities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Generate either numerical or graphical reports organized in
              categories such as household waste, paper, plastic about the
              garbage that has been collected in some area. We will give this
              data in formats like HTML, CSV or PDF and we will cover different
              units of time (days, weeks, months).
            </li>
            <li>
              Report the current situation regarding the collection of trash in
              a certain region, whether it is a clean zone or not.
            </li>
            <li>See reports about the situation in the current zone.</li>
            <li>
              Each waste container will have a QR code that will be scanned
              every time when a worker would want to collect trash.
            </li>
            <li>Add or remove workers that collect trash.</li>
            <li>
              Import/export data about the account of the workers in csv format.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="Types-of-users">
        <h3>2.2 Types of users</h3>
        <p>
          This application will support three groups of users: citizens, workers
          that collect trash and authorized people that manage the recycling
          process.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The citizens will act like the guests of the application because
            they that can only express their dissatisfaction and see the
            situation in their zone.
          </li>
          <li>
            The workers will have an account that will offer information about
            what they have to do and their work will be monitored.
          </li>
          <li>
            The persons that manage the whole process of trash collection will
            have another type of account and they will act like some
            administrators of the application. They will have the ability to see
            what each worker did and to compare that with what the citizens
            reported. Also, they will be the only users that will have the
            ability to create or delete accounts and to use the import/export
            functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="Operating-environment">
        <h3>2.3 Operating environment</h3>
        <p>
          The users will access this application via a browser that can be
          hosted on both desktop operating systems like Windows, Linux or on
          mobile platforms such as Android, iOS. We will add an open source
          license to this project that will follow the terms stipulated by
          Creative Commons.
        </p>

        <section id="Frontend-technologies">
          <h3>2.3.1 Frontend technologies</h3>
          <p>We will use HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript on the frontend side.</p>
          <p>
            In order to simplify our work, we will use the Sass programming
            language because it lets us organize our css code in a better way.
            Also, our project will include the usage of Babel due to the fact
            that it offers us access to the modern functionalities of
            Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application will have to be made responsive since it will be
            available on phone browsers.
          </p>
          <section id="Backend-technologies">
            <h3>2.3.2 Backend technologies</h3>
            <p>
              Node.js will be used to build the backend side because it is one
              of the best choices when it comes to execution speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              No frameworks like Express will be used. Similarly, no SDK like
              googleapis-npm is allowed to be used. Everything will be made via
              a GraphQL/REST service with the help of libcurl library.
            </p>
            <p>
              The MVC design pattern will be used to structure the application
              because it offers maintainability and it helps for parallel work.
              Besides this, the project will contain a personal an API
              GraphQL/REST. We will base our implementation on microservices and
              we will need to offer a minimal level of security that will
              protect our application against popular web attacks such as Cross
              Site Scripting sau SQL injection.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will have to include an administration module that will be
              based on configuration files. Also, we will use Ajax in order to
              establish the communication between the client and the server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regarding how we will store data, we are going to use sqlite due
              to its simplicity.
